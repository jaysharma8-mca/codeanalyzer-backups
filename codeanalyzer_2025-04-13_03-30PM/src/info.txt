Project: Linux-to-Windows Automated Backup via SSH using Python

Step-by-Step Setup Process:

• Installed Oracle VirtualBox 7.1.2 on Windows 11 (latest version gave errors)
• Downloaded Ubuntu Server 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) ISO (~1.5 GB)
• Created a new VM in VirtualBox:
  - Type: Linux
  - Version: Ubuntu (64-bit)
  - Name: UbuntuSSH
  - Memory: 2048 MB
  - Hard disk: 25 GB, dynamically allocated

• Started VM and mounted Ubuntu ISO
• Performed manual Ubuntu installation:
  - Created custom username and password
  - Enabled "Install OpenSSH server"
  - Marked user as administrator (sudo access)

• In case sudo access was not granted initially:
  - Open terminal and ran: `pkexec visudo`
  - Entered root password
  - After the line: `root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
    Added this line: `<your_username>    ALL=(ALL) ALL`
  - Saved and exited

• After reboot, confirmed SSH is active with:
  `sudo systemctl status ssh`

• Set up port forwarding in VirtualBox:
  - Network → Adapter 1 → NAT → Advanced → Port Forwarding
  - Rule added:
    Name: SSH
    Protocol: TCP
    Host Port: 2222
    Guest Port: 22

• On Windows, opened PowerShell and verified SSH access with:
  `ssh <username>@localhost -p 2222`

• Inside Ubuntu, created test folder structure:
  `~/codeanalyzer/src/main.py`

• Created this info.txt file:
  `~/codeanalyzer/info.txt`

• Installed Python on Windows with these libraries:
  `pip install paramiko scp`

• Created `backup_codeanalyzer.py` on Windows:
  - Connects to Linux VM via SSH
  - Copies the entire `codeanalyzer` folder
  - Saves it in `D:\codeAnalyzer Backup\codeanalyzer_<date>_<time>`

Next steps to be implemented:

• Push the backup folder to a GitHub repository
• Compare folder sizes (Linux vs Windows)
• Send email confirmation with backup summary and sizes
